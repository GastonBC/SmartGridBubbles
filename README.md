# SmartGridBubbles
Revit addin that turns on the correct grid bubbles

If downloading the zip release, unblock the dll (gif at the bottom)!

Turn on top and left bubbles and turn off the rest, useful for large plans

Does not work with diagonal/multi segment grids

## Installation

1. Download the compressed file from the releases section
2. Unzip all files in your revit addins folder

Normally, this will be the folder. You need to choose your Revit version here

> C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Revit\Addins


Finally you will need to unblock the DLLs in order to use the addin*

1. Click each DLL file and click on properties
2. Tick the "Unblock" box
3. Press Close

This needs to be done for Utilities.dll also

*These files are not malicious but Windows will block these types of downloads for safety. You can review all code and even build it yourself if that's something you fancy.
